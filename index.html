            <p class="name-arif">Love is bad, in the original meaning of bad. It’s sick, in the original meaning of sick. At least the love we think of, as love, is such. But, perhaps, we don’t know love. Perhaps what we label love is an emotional state of mind prone to anguish and torment which has nothing whatsoever to do with love.</p>

              “You love her
              But she loves him
              And he loves somebody else
              You just can’t win
              And so it goes
              Till the day you die
              This thing they call love
              It’s gonna make you cry
              I’ve had the blues
              The reds and the pinks
              One thing for sure
              Love stinks”</p>
